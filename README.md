# Optimization of the Semantics in a Diffusion Model for Point-Based Image Editing

This repository contains my evaluations and modifications of DragDiffusion, as my final project for MAT1510, *Deep Learning: Theory & Data Science*, at the University of Toronto.

The objective of this work is to enhance the semantic alignment capabilities of diffusion models used in point-based image editing. 

## Results

## Structure
- `Evaluations.ipynb`: My Jupyter Notebook containing evaluations and results.
- `DragDiff_edited/`: A modified version of the original DragDiffusion repository, including my edits for experimentation.

## Credits
The `DragDiff_edited` folder is based on the open-source **DragDiffusion repository** (https://github.com/original-dragdiffusion-repo). My edits and experiments build upon their work.

## License
Please refer to the original DragDiffusion repository for licensing information related to their code.
